## `ViewFrame` functions and properties

### `ViewFrame.Flipped`

*(Formerly part of `GetGameParameter`, which is now obsolete)*

```ags
eFlipDirection ViewFrame.Flipped
```

Gets/sets whether this frame is flipped.

Example:

```ags
ViewFrame *frame = Game.GetViewFrame(WALKING, 2, 4);
if (frame.Flipped) {
    Display("This frame is flipped");
}
else {
    Display("This frame is not flipped");
}
```

*Compatibility:* Since **AGS 4.0.0** it now accepts an `eFlipDirection` value instead of `bool`.

*See also:* [`Game.GetViewFrame`](Game#gamegetviewframe),
[`ViewFrame.Graphic`](ViewFrame#viewframegraphic),
[`eFlipDirection`](StandardEnums#eflipdirection)

### `ViewFrame.Frame`

*(Formerly part of `GetGameParameter`, which is now obsolete)*

```ags
readonly int ViewFrame.Frame
```

Returns the frame number represented by this ViewFrame.

Example:

```ags
ViewFrame *frame = Game.GetViewFrame(WALKING, 2, 4);
Display("This ViewFrame is view %d, loop %d, frame %d",
        frame.View, frame.Loop, frame.Frame);
```

*See also:* [`Game.GetViewFrame`](Game#gamegetviewframe),
[`ViewFrame.Loop`](ViewFrame#viewframeloop),
[`ViewFrame.View`](ViewFrame#viewframeview)

### `ViewFrame.Graphic`

*(Formerly part of `GetGameParameter`, which is now obsolete)*

```ags
int ViewFrame.Graphic
```

Gets/sets the sprite slot number that this view frame displays.

Example:

```ags
ViewFrame *frame = Game.GetViewFrame(WALKING, 2, 4);
Display("This frame uses sprite %d", frame.Graphic);

### `ViewFrame.LinkedAudio`

*(Formerly known as `ViewFrame.Sound`, which is now obsolete)*<br>
*(Formerly known as `SetFrameSound`, which is now obsolete)*<br>
*(Formerly part of `GetGameParameter`, which is now obsolete)*

```ags
AudioClip* ViewFrame.LinkedAudio
```

Gets/sets the audio clip that plays when this frame comes around in
animations.

If there is no linked sound, this should be *null*.

Example:

```ags
ViewFrame *frame = Game.GetViewFrame(WALKING, 2, 4);
if (frame.LinkedAudio == null)
{
    Display("This frame has no frame-linked audio.");
}
else
{
    frame.LinkedAudio.Play();
}
```

checks view WALKING to see if frame 4 in loop 2 has a linked audio clip;
if so, plays it.

*Compatibility:* Supported by **AGS 3.2.0** and later versions.

*See also:* [`Game.GetViewFrame`](Game#gamegetviewframe), [`Character.ScaleVolume`](Character#characterscalevolume)
